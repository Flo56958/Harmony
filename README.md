# Harmony

### **_DISCLAIMER:_**
This program works by recording all mouse and keyboard inputs (globally) from the main computer and disable those user inputs if the cursor is on the other computer (according to Harmony). These inputs are then send encrypted to the other computer (specified by the user) over the network and will be executed. **There fore it is possible for security and antivirus software to rate Harmony as malicious and block it from executing.**

## What does Harmony do?
Harmony is a simple WPF-C#-Programm to share Mouse- and Keyboard-Inputs between computers. It makes using multiple computers at once more comfortable as it treats the other computer simply as a extra monitor.
